# Lets outline the problem 

You're working with a **team of four** during the **Game Jam**.

Bob wants to **playtest** Timmy's **changes**.

**Adam**, the **artist** who **doesn't know how to use Github** wants to test the game.

# The problem continued

There's a hour left, everyone is exhausted.

You have to manually fetch the latest change and build the project.

Suddenly there's a problem with the build without much time to fix it.
