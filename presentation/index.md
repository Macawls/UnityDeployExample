# A little bit about me 

![h:260 center](https://macawls.dev/apu-gallery/apu/happyandcomfy.png)

* I've always enjoyed messing with things!
* Linux and Open-Source :heart:
* DRY -> **Don't repeat yourself!**
* RTFM -> [Read the fucking manual](http://readthefuckingmanual.com/)

# Source Control is Important! <!--fit-->

For the love of all things holy **please use source control** when making a game in a team.

### Git is the most popular. 

Other good **options** for Unity include:
* [Plastic SCM(Built In)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlasticSCMPlugin.html)
* [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/)

# Lets outline the problem 

You're working with a **team of four** during the **Game Jam**.

Bob wants to **playtest** Timmy's **changes**.

**Adam**, the **artist** who **doesn't know how to use Github** wants to test the game.

# The problem continued

There's a hour left, everyone is exhausted.

You have to manually fetch the latest change and build the project.

Suddenly there's a problem with the build without much time to fix it.

# The Solution! What is CI/CD? <!--fit-->


![bg left:27% h:300](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/385/979/26b.png)

* CI - Continous Integration
* CD - Continous Deployment

### Definiton
"CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing **automation** into the stages of app development."

### Why is it useful?
Deliver improvements and fixes **MUCH** faster and have the peace of mind your code is build ready and safe for production.

# What is Github Actions? 
"GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline."

![h:420 center](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/site/features/actions-workflow.svg)

# What can I do with GitHub Actions? 
### Many things!

![bg right:40% h:600](https://i.imgur.com/tKw28I3.png)
* Automatically **test** your game to make sure its ready for production.
* Automatically **build** your game on the cloud.
* Automatically **publish** your game to multiple stores!
---



# Is it all free?

### Pretty much!
https://github.com/pricing


The game in the example repository takes around **4 minutes** per **platform** (Windows, Web, Mac) to build and deploy.

With the **free 2000 CI/CD minutes limit** that equates to a maximum of around **160 builds per month**!

Quick to implement + easy to use = **abstraction**.

If you're interested in learning more, have a look at [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which solves the problem of "It doesn't work on my machine!".
